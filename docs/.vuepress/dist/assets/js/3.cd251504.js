Essentially, all of the Chinese martial arts can be divided into two main branches, which are so-called Internal styles or Buddhist styles and so called External styles orTaoist styles. It doesn’t mean thou, that all the practitioners of External styles are Buddhists and all the practitioners of Internal styles are Taoists.It only means that External styles have closer to the philosophy of Buddhism and Internal styles have closer to the philosophy of Taoism. Here we need to emphasize the word philosophy, because martial arts do not necessary have a connection to religions. We would need a whole lecture to explain the differences betweenExternal and Internal styles in detail. In short we can say that External styles are characterized by speed and hardness, while in Internal styles fast movements alternate with slow movements and hardness is conquered by softness,but softness and hardness are complementary, which means that we can find hardness in softness and softness in hardness.  To the naked eye, External styles may seem more dynamic, the movements have wider range and seem to be harder, on the contrary, Internal styles may seem slower, more gracious and softer.  It should be noted that both styles have much to offer, it depends what one is looking for.")]),n("p",[n("strong",[e._v("Wujiquan")]),e._v("  - No limits/boundaries style.
