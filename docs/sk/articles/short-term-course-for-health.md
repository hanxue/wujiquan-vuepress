# Life Nourishing Exercises

Life nourishing methods and health exercise can be divided into 2 main areas

1. Still practice
2. Moving practice

**Still practice** is Neigong - Internal work, also called Zhan zhuang – Standing meditation. Neigong uses special breathing method, which focuses the spirit, calms down the heart, opens energy channels, and helps to circulate Qi and blood.

Moving practices are Wujiquan like Six Healing Sounds, Eight Pieces of Brocade, Five Animal Method (a lot of other schools have methods with the same name, but each school has its specialties and they can look very different) and special life nourishing methods set which is only found in Wujiquan. 

All of these methods are designed to exercise the whole body, although some are more focused on exercising joints, ligaments and muscles, some are more focused on exercising internal organs and some focus more on different energy channels.

All of life nourishing methods and health exercise follow the circle of mutual production of the 5 Elements/Phases which is: Metal, Water, Wood, Fire, and Earth. Each one of the 5 Elements represents an internal organ; metal represents lungs, water represents kidneys, wood represents liver, fire represents heart, earth represents spleen.  

Life nourishing methods and health exercise stress the harmony of Yin and Yang, which is the harmony of right and left, front and back, inside and outside, full and hollow organs… By practicing these, one can tune in the rhythm of the Nature and increase health, build up the body and get rid of diseases.

## Goal of the practice

If you have sickness, heal the sickness. If you don’t have sickness, build up the body.

Harmonize spirit, nourish heart, sooth liver, assist spleen, invigorate lungs, tonify kidneys, condition triple burner, open and unblock energy channels, enhance circulation of blood and Qi (vital energy). Fill the whole body with strength and multiply inner strength.
