Classes start with life-nourishing and qigong practice in a group, then individual practice of forms. At the end those who are interested in self defense and fighting skills practice push hands (a form of wrestling in internal martial arts).

This practice is beneficial for muscles, ligaments, joints as well as internal organs. Through continuous practice, one can balance yin and yang in the body (which means to balance the internal organs, as well as right and left, lower and upper, back and front sides of the body), master the coordination between different body parts, preserve health, joyful mood and calm down the mind. It is suitable for adults of all ages. One of the aims of these classes is also to train future teachers of Wujiquan. Students who have mastered the basic curriculum will have the opportunity to assist in the class and even to become indoor disciples, which will allow them to represent and teach Wujiquan.

#Wujiquan
### No limits/boundaries style

Wuji refers to the state before the Big Bang, when everything was One. It is an ancient Internal martial art system. If we want to trace its origin, we must begin with the Book of Changes (Yijing, Zhou Yi). Yijing describes actions in nature and laws of these actions. Yijing has been compiled over many generations; its essence is the observation of phenomenon that are happening in the human body (micro-cosmos) and in our surroundings (macro-cosmos). All of these phenomenon have some laws according to which they behave and which we can discover by mindful and aware observation. In this process it is essential to get to know our own body, get to understand it, make it stronger and healthier. Wujiquan is based precisely on these principles, which are healing our body and prolonging our life, building our body, strengthening it and also learn how to defend it if necessary. Wujiquan is one of the five Taoist arts that were thought only within the family or in monastery.

**In Wujiquan Wude (Martial virtues) is the most important part. It includes:"Respect", "Tolerance", "Compassion","Righteousness", "Goodness”, “Elimination"(of one’s bad habits).**

In Wujiquan there are empty hand forms, weapon forms (short stick, broadsword,sword …) push hands (wrestling in Internal martial arts), sanshou (free fight), neigong (internal work), pressure points techniques, life nourishing exercise,etc. Great emphasis is put on push hands, which is the basic for the free fight. Long term practice of Wujiquan has positive effects on one’s health. It can prevent and control high/low blood pressure, diabetes, different kinds of stomach and intestines problems, problems with joints and spine… Wujiquan is suitable for all ages and genders.
