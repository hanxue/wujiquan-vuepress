Each one of the 5 Elements represents an internal organ; metal represents lungs, water represents kidneys, wood represents liver, fire represents heart, earth represents spleen.</p><p>Life nourishing methods and health exercise stress the harmony of Yin and Yang, which is the harmony of right and left, front and back, inside and outside, full and hollow organs… By practicing these, one can tune in the rhythm of the Nature and increase health, build up the body and get rid of diseases.</p><h2 id="goal-of-the-practice"><a href="#goal-of-the-practice" aria-hidden="true" class="header-anchor">#</a> Goal of the practice</h2><p>If you have sickness, heal the sickness.
